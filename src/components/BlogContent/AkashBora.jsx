            Smart India Hackathon, or SIH, is the largest national-level hackathon organized
            by the Government of India, with participation from nearly every college across
            the nation each year. Contrary to what many non-technical people might
            assume, the word 'hackathon' doesn’t imply hacking as portrayed in sci-fi movies
            with cryptic codes on flashing screens. Instead, the essence of SIH lies in
            promoting innovation, can be software or hardware, aiming to create impactful
            solutions.
            <br />
            In brief, SIH is a competition where some major organizations from all over India
            provide real-world problem statements, challenging the youth (college students)
            to develop practical solutions and present prototypes for potential
            implementation.
            <br />
            Our team, Terabyte, representing Girijananda Chowdhury University, not only
            participated in the prestigious competition last year but also proudly emerged as
            one of the winners.
            <br />
            In the 2024 Smart India Hackathon, over 4.9 lakh college students registered,
            with 50,000 teams nominated by Higher Education Institutes (HEIs), each team
            comprising up to six members. Each problem statement in SIH can have only
            one winner. The competition featured 254 problem statements (186 software
            based and 68 hardware-based), with five finalists selected for the grand finale
            from each problem statement.
            <br />
            Among the numerous challenges presented, our team chose a problem
            statement by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL): developing an offline AI image
            recognition chatbot software. This challenge attracted over 400 submissions,
            and our team secured a spot among the top five finalists. Once shortlisted,
            teams must travel to a nodal center, which could be located anywhere in India.
            For us, that destination was Welingkar Institute of Management, Mumbai.
            <br />
            Our team, comprising six first-semester students and guided by our mentor,
            competed against four other teams tackling the same problem statement. Among
            them were strong contenders from well-known institutes like IIT Kharagpur,
            making the challenge even more intense. Along the way, we also interacted with
            other teams working on different problem statements, including those developing
            prototypes for esteemed organizations like the NSG.
            <br />
            BEL, being part of the Ministry of Defense, had specific requirements for the
            software, the software must operate offline, be capable of training with custom
            datasets, and fully interactive user interface. We not only met their expectations
            but also introduced additional features that left a positive impression on the
            judges. As the team leader, I documented every step of the process—from
            crafting presentations and developing prototypes to outlining the roadmap.
            Looking ahead, I aim to mentor future participants from our college, sharing
            insights and guiding them toward success.
            <br />
            Winning the hackathon as first-semester students was an incredible experience,
            and people often ask how we managed it. Honestly, I had a bit of background in
            programming and software development, having worked on some commercial
            projects before, which gave me confidence in developing a prototype.
            Although my team members were new to coding, I advised them on what to
            learn and implement, assigning tasks based on their strengths. For example,
            Sankhyarick Swami, a web enthusiast from our team, handled the website
            development for our software, while Rishav Kumar Singh, with his C++
            experience and some knowledge of AI, researched about the model and training
            part. Our mentor, Adarsh Pradhan, was a pillar of support throughout the
            process. With his prior expertise in AI/ML, he motivated and guided us every
            step of the way.
            <br />
            Most of the problem statements in SIH revolve around AI/ML technologies, as
            they represent the future of innovation.
            <br />
            In the next section, I will explain what we built, how it works, and the tools we
            used to develop the prototype. We named our software prototype SIR—short for
            Smart Image Recognition. Designed for desktop computers, SIR not only
            identifies objects in an image but also provides detailed information about them.
            <br />
            The most impressive feature? It works entirely offline, ensuring seamless
            performance without internet dependency
            For example, when an image of a simple water bottle placed on a table is
            provided to the software, and the question "What is the object on the table?" is
            asked, the software accurately identifies it as a bottle. If the label or shape is
            recognized, it can also determine the brand or company associated with the
            bottle.
            <br />
            To evaluate the software’s accuracy, judges conducted this live test. When an
            image of a Bisleri bottle was given, our system swiftly recognized it. As an
            additional test, a question unrelated to the image was asked: "Where is the
            Bisleri Headquarters located?" The software promptly responded with "Mumbai,
            Maharashtra." Note that no internet connection was used to get this information.
            The magic lies in the AI model itself. Our application is built primarily in Python,
            leveraging the power of PyTorch and Transformers to integrate LLaVA—a
            pretrained, advanced model for image recognition and response generation.
            With over 7 billion parameters, this model delivers richer contextual
            understanding, enhanced reasoning, and greater accuracy in tasks. The model
            holds comprehensive data on objects along with detailed relevant information,
            enabling the AI chatbot to deliver precise identification and contextual insights.
            Moreover, our application allows for training and fine-tuning the model with
            custom datasets, ensuring adaptability to specific requirements.
            <br />

            In addition to these core features, we have incorporated multilingual support,
            batch processing, a model manager, speech recognition, and even live image
            and video imports. Perhaps the most powerful addition is our extension
            workflows, which enable further enhancements such as geo-tagging, OCR, and
            seamless integration of automated alert systems.
            <br />
            Every feature of our software was tested live by the judges in one-on-one
            interactions, where the whole team provided detailed explanations. As the lead, I
            guided the entire feature flow during the evaluations. Beyond just testing, the
            judges challenged us further by asking us to implement new features on the
            spot, ensuring that the software was genuinely developed by our team.
            The nonstop 36-hour hackathon was intense, both mentally and physically
            exhausting. However, our strong team spirit and strategic planning helped us
            navigate through each round smoothly. With two rounds in total, we successfully
            managed to win both. Welingkar Institute provided excellent support, efficiently
            managing everything from accommodations and meals to the overall hackathon
            experience.
            <br />
            Winning the national-level hackathon came with a ₹1 lakh prize, which was
            certainly rewarding. But beyond the monetary benefit, the real victory lay in the
            recognition it brought. As I’ve heard from many, such achievements attract
            significant attention and credibility in the tech space. However, what truly
            mattered was the journey itself—traveling from east to west, collaborating and
            sharing insights, and learning invaluable lessons. That experience is what stays
            with us.
            <br />

            Our university showed incredible generosity by rewarding us with an additional
            ₹1.5 lakh for winning the hackathon. We are deeply grateful to our prestigious
            institution for recognizing our hard work and dedication. This was our first time
            participating, and our first time winning. We approached the challenge with
            meticulous preparation, strictly following all SIH guidelines, thoroughly analyzing
            the problem statement, with proper planning and execution with a well
            developed prototype. Teamwork played a crucial role in our success, motivating
            and supporting each team member was essential in overcoming challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            CONCLUSION
            <br />
            While not everyone on our team had a background in coding, each member
            contributed in their own way, and their efforts played a vital role in our journey.
            I always encourage my friends to learn new skills and participate in events like
            this. Even when they feel less confident, I remind them that failure is just a
            stepping-stone toward success and nothing to be afraid of.
            Our team went on to participate in several smaller hackathons after this, even
            securing victories in some of them. We aspire to participate in more tech events
            in the future and advance our careers.
