            Codénix Club hosted a vibrant welcome event tailored for the newly
            joined freshers of the 2025 batch. With a strong turnout and
            enthusiastic participation, the 1.5-hour session was designed to
            spark curiosity, dispel fears, and guide students toward meaningful
            learning paths in tech.
            <b>Session 1:</b> Mythbusters - “Will AI Take Our Jobs? We kicked
            off with a thought-provoking discussion around a common concern:
            Will AI replace human jobs?

                <li>
                    Students were invited to share their opinions, followed by a
                    presentation of real-world data and trends.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Through interactive dialogue, we debunked the myth and
                    emphasized how AI is more likely to augment human
                    capabilities than replace them.

                    The session helped boost confidence and encouraged a
                    future-ready mindset.{" "}

            <b>Session 2:</b> Understanding the basic Tech Stack Next, we
            introduced freshers to the foundational tech stacks across major
            domains like web development, game development, Ai/ML and more. We
            discussed industry-recommended stacks and offered guidance on how to
            begin learning them, aligning with current job market trends. The
            goal was to empower students with clarity and direction for their
            tech journey.
