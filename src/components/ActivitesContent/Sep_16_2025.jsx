            On 16th September 2025, our coding club successfully hosted the
            internal round for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025. The event
            served as a platform for shortlisting the most promising teams to
            represent our institution in the national-level competition. Held at
            the MCA Lab, the session brought together innovation, collaboration,
            and critical feedback in a tightly packed two-hour window.
            <br />
            <br />
            A panel of esteemed judges was present to evaluate the teams
            based on:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside indent-2">
                <li>Problem understanding and relevance</li>
                <li>Technical approach and innovation</li>
                <li>Presentation clarity and teamwork</li>
                <li>Scalability and potential impact</li>
            </ul>
            Judges also provided constructive feedback and suggestions to help
            teams refine their ideas before the final submission. Their insights
            were instrumental in guiding participants toward more robust and
            user-centric solutions. The MCA Lab buzzed with energy as club
            members actively supported the teams, asked questions, and engaged
            in discussions. The event fostered a spirit of healthy competition
            and peer learning, reinforcing our club's commitment to nurturing
            talent and promoting collaborative growth.
            <br />

            The internal round concluded with the judges shortlisting
            top-performing teams for further mentoring and preparation. These
            teams will now move forward to represent our university in the
            official SIH 2025 submission process.
